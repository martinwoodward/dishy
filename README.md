# Dishy Tips
Resources to learn more about my Starlink terminal, Dishy McDishface. Thanks to my Starbuddy @MylesBorins for all the help and conversations, along with [UniFi banter](https://github.com/mylesborins/starlink-tools).

For more information on what Starlink is, see starlink.com and/or the r/Starlink subreddit.
